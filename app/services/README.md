# `app/services/` - application-workflow layer

Services live between the HTTP layer ([`routes/`](../routes/README.md))
and the persistence layer ([`models/`](../models/README.md)). They own
multi-step workflow logic: register a team, start a match, recompute
a schedule. Routes call into a service for anything non-trivial.

Each `*_service.py` file owns one workflow area; read the module
docstring to see what it covers. `dual_write.py` is the canonical
interface for the four normalised join tables - call its helpers
instead of querying those tables directly.

## `RegistrationService` methods

The registration service provides the following key methods:

- **`register_team(tournament_url, team_id, pseudonym)`** — Register a team to a
  tournament. Returns `PENDING_TEAM_APPROVAL` or `CONFIRMED` depending on
  league/tournament config.
- **`register_player(tournament_url, player_id, team_id=None, ...)`** — Register a
  player to a tournament (optionally under a team). Returns `PENDING_TEAM_APPROVAL`
  or `CONFIRMED` depending on config.
- **`organizer_checkin(tournament_url, *, actor_user_id, actor_user_type, player_id, team_id=None, ...)`** — Organizer-driven player check-in. The actor must be a TO for the tournament. Always returns a `CONFIRMED`, fully-paid `PlayerRegistration` with `paid=True, amount_paid=0`. Rejects with `OrganizerCheckinDisabledError` when `tournament.organizer_checkin_enabled` is `False`. Existing `CANCELLED`/`REJECTED` registrations for the same (tournament, player) are reused; existing `CONFIRMED` rows return a duplicate-error.
- **`organizer_register_team(tournament_url, *, actor_user_id, actor_user_type, team_id, pseudonym="")`** - Organizer-driven team registration. The actor must be a TO for the tournament. Returns a CONFIRMED, fully-paid `TeamRegistration` with `paid=True, amount_paid=0`. Rejects with `OrganizerCheckinDisabledError` when `tournament.organizer_checkin_enabled` is `False`. Honors `n_max_teams` (error message includes the count and limit). Existing `CANCELLED` rows for the same (tournament, team) are reused; existing `CONFIRMED` rows return a duplicate-error.

## Conventions

### Static-method namespace classes

Most services are dataclasses that act as typed namespaces:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RegistrationService:
    @staticmethod
    def register_team(tournament_url: str, team_id: str, pseudonym: str) -> Result["TeamRegistration", ArctosError]:
        ...
```

There's no instance state. The class form is purely for grouping and
type-checking - call methods as `RegistrationService.register_team(...)`.

### `Result[T, ArctosError]` returns

Services return `Result` (from
[`app/error_values.py`](../error_values.py)) instead of raising. Routes
pattern-match on `Ok` / `Err` to convert to JSON. Inside a service the
`.Q()` method short-circuits with the contained error - but only when
the function is wrapped in `@allow_Q`:

```python
@staticmethod
@allow_Q
def start_match(...) -> Result["Match", ArctosError]:
    match = MatchActionsService._require_match(tournament_url, match_id).Q()  # propagates Err
    ...
    return Ok(match)
```

### Flask-agnostic where possible

`permission_service.py` is the cleanest example: it never touches
`current_user`, `request`, `flash`, or `redirect`. Pass the `user`
object in. Keeping services Flask-free makes them straightforward to
test and reuse from background tasks.

### `dual_write.py`

Don't query `MatchPlayer`/`MatchReferee`/`HeadRefAllowList`/
`CameraTimepoint` directly from routes or services. Use the helpers
here:

```python
from app.services.dual_write import (
    get_match_player_ids,
    set_match_referees_from_csv,
    get_head_ref_allowlist_ids,
)

players = get_match_player_ids(match, side=WinnerSide.TEAM1)
set_match_referees_from_csv(match, "Alice,Bob,Charlie")
allowed = get_head_ref_allowlist_ids(tournament)
```

The helpers handle invariants (slot ordering, orphan-FK behaviour,
unique-on-`(match_uuid, player_id)`) so callers don't re-implement
them.

## Adding a service

1. Pick a name that describes a workflow (`*Service`), not a noun the
   models already cover.
2. Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` and `@staticmethod` methods unless you
   genuinely need instance state.
3. Return `Result[T, ArctosError]`. Wrap in `@allow_Q` if you want to
   use `.Q()` internally.
4. Don't import from `flask` (or do so only behind a function-local
   import) - keep the boundary clean.
5. Write a unit test in `tests/unit/`, plus an integration test that
   hits the route that wraps it.

## Example: starting a match

Tracing `MatchService.start_match` shows how the layers cooperate:

1. **Route** (`app/routes/_api.py`) parses request, calls
   `MatchService.start_match(...)`.
2. **`MatchService.start_match`** (this directory):
   - Asks `MatchActionsService._require_match` to fetch and validate
     the match exists and belongs to the tournament. Uses `.Q()` to
     short-circuit on `Err`.
   - Asks `match_start_eligibility.is_eligible_to_start` whether the
     transition is allowed (status, conflicts, ref permissions).
   - Mutates the match: status, started_at, started_by, camera stream
     starts.
   - Calls `dual_write.set_match_players_from_csv` to write the team
     rosters into `match_players`.
   - Triggers `app.utils.scheduling.recompute_all_match_times` so any
     dynamically-scheduled successors update their start times.
3. Returns `Ok(match)` or `Err(error)`.
