# `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models

The canonical domain shape: every persisted Arctos entity is defined
here. Models are imported via `from app.models import ...` (preferred) or
`from models import ...` - the top-level `models.py` re-exports
everything in this package so both forms work.

## What's in here

| File | Defines | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `base.py` | `db = SQLAlchemy()` | The single shared SQLAlchemy instance. Import `db` from `app.models.base` (or `app.models`). |
| `constants.py` | Column-length constants (`URL_SLUG_LEN`, `USER_ID_LEN`, ...). | Use these instead of hand-typing column lengths. |
| `user.py` | `Player`, `Team` | Both subclass `UserMixin` - Flask-Login can log either in. |
| `league.py` | `League` | Groups multiple tournaments under one registration config. |
| `tournament.py` | `Tournament`, `TO`, `Field`, `Tag` | Plus the TO (Tournament Organiser) assignment table and field/tag entities. |
| `registrable_config.py` | `RegistrableConfig` | Shared registration settings (fees, caps, waiver). Tournaments link to one (directly or through their league). |
| `registration.py` | `TeamRegistration`, `PlayerRegistration` | Per-event team / player registrations. |
| `match.py` | `Match`, `Point`, `MatchNote` | Matches, scored points, and notes attached to matches. |
| `penalty_type.py` | `PenaltyType` | TO-defined penalty categories used in match notes. |
| `records.py` | `Injury`, `HeadRef` | Player injury records and per-event head-ref assignments. |
| `sidecomp.py` | `SideComp`, `SideCompResult` | Side competitions (accuracy throw, distance, etc.). |
| `camera.py` | `Camera` | One row per recorded video clip; tracks upload lifecycle. |
| `normalised.py` | `HeadRefAllowList`, `MatchReferee`, `MatchPlayer`, `CameraTimepoint` | Join tables for multi-value relationships. |

## Mental model

```
League (1) ─── (n) Tournament ─── (n) Match ─── (n) Point
   │                  │                │
   │                  ├── (n) Field    ├── (n) MatchPlayer ──┐
   │                  ├── (n) Tag      ├── (n) MatchReferee ─┤
   │                  └── (n) PenaltyType                    │
   │                                                  Player / Team
   ├── (1) RegistrableConfig ──────┐
   └── (n) PenaltyType             │
                                   │
   Tournament ── (1) RegistrableConfig (only when league_id is null)
```

## Patterns

### Mutually exclusive scope columns

Several tables can be scoped *either* to a tournament *or* to a league,
never both. Examples:

- `Tournament(league_id, registrable_config_id)` - exactly one is non-null.
- `TeamRegistration(event, league_id)` - exactly one is non-null.
- `PlayerRegistration(event, league_id)` - same.
- `PenaltyType(event, league_id)` - same.
- `TO(event, league_id)` - same.

This invariant is enforced by a `CHECK` constraint in the database. To
read the scope correctly use the helpers:

```python
from app.utils.helpers import get_registrable_config

cfg = get_registrable_config(tournament)  # follows tournament.league_id automatically
```

### Join tables for multi-value data

Four tables in `normalised.py` hold relationships that don't fit on a
single column:

| Table | Holds |
|-------|-------|
| `HeadRefAllowList` | Players permitted to head-ref a tournament. |
| `MatchReferee` | Ordered referee slots for a match (resolved team + original ASS expression). |
| `MatchPlayer` | Players on each side's field roster for a match. |
| `CameraTimepoint` | Wall-clock -> video-offset sync points for a recording. |

Read and write these through the helpers in
[`app/services/dual_write.py`](../services/dual_write.py):

```python
from app.services.dual_write import get_match_player_ids, set_match_referees_from_csv

team1_ids = get_match_player_ids(match, side=WinnerSide.TEAM1)
set_match_referees_from_csv(match, "Alice,Bob,Charlie")
```

The helpers handle invariants (slot ordering, orphan-FK behaviour,
unique constraints) so callers don't have to.

## Creating a `Tournament`

`Tournament` requires either `league_id` or `registrable_config_id`.

```python
from tests.utils import make_registrable_config
from models import Tournament

cfg = make_registrable_config(team_registration_open=True)
t = Tournament(
    url="my-event",
    name="My Event",
    start_date=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    registrable_config_id=cfg.id,
)
db.session.add(t)
db.session.commit()
```

## Money

`team_reg_fee`, `player_reg_fee`, and both `amount_paid` columns are
`Numeric(10, 2)`. IEEE-754 floats can't represent `$10.00` exactly;
reconciling many partial payments accumulates rounding error. Stay in
`Decimal`.

## Times

Datetime columns store naive UTC: `datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None)`.
The frontend handles timezone display. Don't insert timezone-aware
datetimes - they'll round-trip but break comparisons.

## Adding a model

1. Create a new file in this directory (one model class per file is
   the convention).
2. Import `db` from `app.models.base`, and length constants from
   `app.models.constants`.
3. Add the model to the explicit re-exports in
   [`__init__.py`](__init__.py) so `from models import ...` still works.
4. Generate a migration: `make db-revision MSG="add_my_model"`. Review
   the autogenerated SQL - autogenerate misses things like
   `CheckConstraint` content changes.
5. Back up and apply: `make db-backup && make db-migrate`.

For everything migration-related see
[`migrations/README.md`](../../migrations/README.md).
