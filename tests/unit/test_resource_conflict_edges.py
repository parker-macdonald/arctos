"""Cross-field same-team serialization edges and the planned/nominal pass split.

Design: the planned (scheduled_start_time) pass is purely structural — it omits
the cross-field same-team serialization edge so the planned timeline can't depend
on itself through a shifting edge. The nominal pass includes the edge, anchored on
the now-stable scheduled times. Planned-timeline double-bookings become warnings.
