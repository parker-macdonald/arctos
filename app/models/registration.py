"""Per-event team and player registrations.

Defines :class:`TeamRegistration` and :class:`PlayerRegistration`.
Both tables are scoped *either* to a single tournament (``event``) *or*
to a league (``league_id``), never both - a `CHECK` constraint
enforces the invariant. Use
:func:`app.services.registration_resolver.team_registrations_for_tournament`
(and friends) to query in a way that handles both scopes
transparently.
